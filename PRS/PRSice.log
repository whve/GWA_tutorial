Initializing Genotype file: TOY_TARGET_DATA (bed) 

Start processing TOY_BASE_GWAS 
================================================== 

Base file: TOY_BASE_GWAS.assoc 
91062 variant(s) observed in base file, with: 
88836 total variant(s) included from base file 

Loading Genotype info from target 
================================================== 

2000 people (1024 male(s), 976 female(s)) observed 
2000 founder(s) included 

2226 variant(s) not found in previous data 
88836 variant(s) included 

There are a total of 1 phenotype to process 

Start performing clumping 

128414 MB RAM detected; reserving 1 MB for clumping 

Allocated 1 MB successfully 

Number of variant(s) after clumping : 88836 

Phenotype is a binary phenotype 
1000 control(s) 
1000 case(s) 

There are 1 region(s) with p-value less than 1e-5. Please 
note that these results are inflated due to the overfitting 
inherent in finding the best-fit PRS (but it's still best 
to find the best-fit PRS!). 
You can use the --perm option (see manual) to calculate an 
empirical P-value.
